Baaaa!!
Grass, grass, grass...
Silence is golden
The windy day is not the day for thatching
He who runs away lives to fight another day
Slainte
Its better to try than to hope
Happy days!
Away with the fairies!
You took me from my Irish mother!
BAAAAAH... I'm lucky.
Ye pot of gold is safe with me! Err.. BAAHHH!
They're stealing me lucky charms!
